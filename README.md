# Distance Vector Routing
-Implements a simulation of Distance Vector routing given an initial network topology information containing link costs <br>
-Returns the lowest cost possible link between x node to y node

## Functions

1. Pick a file containing network topology using JAVA's FileChooser GUI
2. Interpret the data from the topology info and build a table giving initial node distances (999 indicates that the nodes are not connected directly)
3. Choose between non stop mode and individual mode. Individual mode gives a result of how the distance vector table changes as per iterations in every node and non stop mode gives the shortest distance between node x and y directly.
4. Get the execution time in seconds
5. Completely GUI based, no need of command terminal after executing

## Execution Steps

> javac lab2.java <br>
> java lab2 <br>
> Pick the file using file chooser, type 1 or 2 to select the node, and view the results in GUI
